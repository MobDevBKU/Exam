### Idea Initiation

ASK YOURSELF BEFORE START:

- What problems and pain points do I want to solve?
- How might I help users with that problem?
- What kind of app am I designing? (e.g., On Demand,
- Dating, Social)
- What is my app supposed to do?
- What is the unique selling point of my app?
- How is my app different from my competitors?
- How will my app appeal to my users?

> Research is a key step in designing the user experience

Market research: 

1. Survey your potential customers
2. Collect relevant data (Social Networks, Statistics,...)
3. Analyze your competitors
4. Apply results to your product

- Define MVP
- User stories
- User flow diagrams
- Determine which platforms ?

## CHAPTER 3: Guide to Mobile App Design

### User Interface Design Basics

UI Elements:

- Input Controls: UI elements that enable users to input information
- Navigation components: UI components that can make it easy to navigate through a mobile app.
- Information Components: UI components that help share information with users
- Containers: UI components that can hold together a full set of components
and content that are related to each other

### Design guideline

- Make onboarding efficient: Show users the real value of your app
- Declutter: Remove all things that are not necessary for the app design
- Minimize User Input
- Breakdown Tasks

### MVP, MVC, MVVM

Model - View - Controller pattern: (MVC) design pattern was introduced by Trygve Reenskaug in the 1970s:
- The **model** is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.
- The **view** renders a presentation of the model in a particular format.
- The **controller** responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it, and then passes the input to the model.

  - Is available over the Internet or private
  (intranet) networks
  - Uses a standardized XML messaging system
  - Is not tied to any one operating system or
  programming language
  - Is self-describing via a common XML
  grammar
  - Is discoverable via a simple find mechanism
### WEB SERVICE COMPONENTS
